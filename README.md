## Lessons Learned
- Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
- ArrayLists
- Parent/Child classes, Interface implementation
- Abstract classes and methods
- Parse, Iterators, InstanceOf
- Input/Output Streams, Try & Catch, FileReaders & BufferedReaders
- Loops : if, for, while, switch
- Most Prominent BrainBlocks
<br>- I eventually had to Google "string to double" for the readFromFile(). I had forgotten about parsing and had such a lightbulb moment that my husband chuckled at me.
<br>- Denise helped me diagnose that the fuelExhaustionTime kept printing out as 0 due to the no-arg constructor being used rather than the constructor that took in arguments/parameters.
